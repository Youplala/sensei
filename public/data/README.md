# Data Directory

This directory contains wordlists and data files used by the Sensei word game.

## File Structure

### Static Files (Version Controlled)
- `semantle_wordlist.txt` - Main vocabulary list used for word selection
- `wordlist.tsv` - Additional word list with metadata

### Dynamic Files (Generated, not in Git)
- `daily.json` - Contains the daily word and similarity scores (generated daily)
- `history.json` - Tracks previously used words to avoid repetition

## Notes for Deployment

When deploying to Vercel:
1. The static wordlists are included in the repository and will be deployed automatically
2. The dynamic files will be generated by the daily cron job
3. Be aware that dynamic files will not persist between deployments on Vercel
4. If you need to preserve history between deployments, consider using:
   - Vercel KV Storage
   - A database solution
   - External file storage (e.g., AWS S3)

## Local Development

For local development, both static and dynamic files are stored locally. The API endpoint
at `/api/generate-daily-word` will create or update the dynamic files when called.
